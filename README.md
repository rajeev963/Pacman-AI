# Pacman AI

A Python implementation of artificial intelligence search algorithms to solve problems within the Berkeley Pac-Man environment. The [Pac-Man Projects, developed at UC Berkeley](http://ai.berkeley.edu), apply AI concepts to the classic arcade game. I help Pac-Man find food, avoid ghosts, and maximise his game score using uninformed and informed state-space search, probabilistic inference, and reinforcement learning.
